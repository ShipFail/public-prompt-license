Public Prompt License - Service Variant (PPL-S)
Version 0.1

Copyright (C) [Year] [Copyright Holder]

This license is based on the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, adapted
for AI Agent Prompt Source.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 0.1 of the Public Prompt License - Service Variant.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks or database rights.

"The Prompt Source" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients"
may be individuals or organizations.

"Prompt Source" means the human-readable natural language instructions,
structured data, and configuration files that define the behavior, persona,
logic, and capabilities of an AI agent, as defined in the Public Prompt
License Definitions (Version 0.1).

"Corresponding Prompt Source" for a work in Compiled Form means all the
Prompt Source needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the Compiled Form and to modify the Prompt Source, including scripts
to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Prompt Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
and other parts of the work.

"Agent Service" means a service that enables users to interact with an
AI agent or system powered by the Prompt Source, typically over a
computer network or via an API.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Prompt Source, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are
met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
unmodified Prompt Source. The output from running a covered work is covered
by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other
equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the
WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Prompt Source's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added
in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of
the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this
License along with the Prompt Source.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Prompt Source, or the modifications to
produce it from the Prompt Source, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
  and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
  under this License and any conditions added under section 7.

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
  to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
  therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
  to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
  are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work
  in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you
  have separately received it.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Prompt Source under the terms of this License, in one of
these ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  Corresponding Prompt Source fixed on a durable physical medium
  customarily used for software interchange.

  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
  offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
  offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to
  give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
  Corresponding Prompt Source for all the software in the product
  that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
  customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more
  than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying
  of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Prompt Source
  from a network server at no charge.

  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  written offer to provide the Corresponding Prompt Source. This
  alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
  only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
  with subsection 6b.

  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
  Corresponding Prompt Source in the same way through the same place
  at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
  Corresponding Prompt Source along with the object code. If the place
  to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Prompt
  Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
  party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
  maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to
  find the Corresponding Prompt Source. Regardless of what server hosts
  the Corresponding Prompt Source, you remain obligated to ensure that
  it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
  Prompt Source of the work are being offered to the general public
  at no charge under subsection 6d.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Prompt Source
shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the
extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Prompt Source, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Prompt Source remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of
section 11).

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Prompt Source. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Prompt Source or a work on which the Prompt Source is based.
The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
"control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
the contents of its contributor version.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Interaction with Agent Services.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you perform the
Prompt Source publicly (e.g., by running it as an Agent Service accessible
via a network), you must make the Corresponding Prompt Source available
to all users interacting with it.

You must provide a prominent opportunity for such users to receive the
Corresponding Prompt Source of your version by providing access to the
Corresponding Prompt Source from a network server at no charge, through
some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.
This Corresponding Prompt Source shall include the Prompt Source defined
in the Public Prompt License Definitions (Version 0.1), including the
Narrative Core, Cognitive Architecture, and Interface Definitions active
for that interaction.

This obligation does not extend to the underlying software infrastructure,
inference engines, hardware drivers, or the implementation code of tools,
provided that such software is not required to understand or modify the
cognitive behavior of the agent defined in the Prompt Source.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The ShipFail Project (or its successor) may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Public Prompt License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROMPT SOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROMPT SOURCE "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE PROMPT SOURCE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROMPT SOURCE PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROMPT SOURCE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROMPT SOURCE (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROMPT SOURCE TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
